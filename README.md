Conversational Interfaces DESGN-670-05 (4034)
## Spring 2017


The course will introduce students to the foundations of conversational interaction with technology. The material is split into the following 3 parallel threads:
- socio-linguistic phenomena of human-human communication
- technology behind human-agent interactions that mirror those phenomena
- building an actual conversational application

Topics:
- Product space and design space of conversational agents.
- task-oriented and non-task-oriented interaction.
- Verbal/non-verbal behaviors
- entrainment, alignment, common ground
- turn-taking, timing, non-verbal audio
- Entry to the market: When to ship an interactive product?
- Experimentation and Measurement
- Homophily
- Ethics
- Final project

Learning outcomes:
By the end of the course, the students will have hands-on understanding of the product and design space of a conversationally interactive technology. They will become familiar with limitations of current state of the art, and learn to envision effective conversational interfaces that navigate around these limitations.
