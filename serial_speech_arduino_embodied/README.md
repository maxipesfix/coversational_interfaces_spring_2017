# Installing 

This version controls pin 13 of your Arduino via voice commands using Google voice API. It is using Serial connection with Arduino, and therefore has to run as a Chome extension, not a usual chrome page. The code is mostly the same.

1. Connect Arduino to your Mac via USB.
2. Upload the sketch inside sketches/serial_light/serial_light.ino to your Arduino.
3. On Chrome browser: go to chrome://extensions , select Developer mode
4. Press "Load unpacked extension" and go to this folder.
5. Press Launch.
6. The window with the character and the round LED indicator should come up. If the LED indicator is grey, just press "Reload".
7. Use right click (two-finger click on a Mac trackpad) and choose "Inspect" to open Console window for debugging
8. Test that light works by pressing "Toggle LED" button.
9. Press "Speak" and say "Turn lights on" or "Turn lights off" 
10. Modify to your liking

# Arduino LED toggle

Note: on Mac OS X Lion, it's necessary to update USB Serial drivers:

This sample shows a big button that lets you toggle between the on/off
state of an LED connected to an Arduino.

1. Install the LED sketch on your Duo.
2. Attach a LED to pin 2 (with a resistor to not burn it out).
3. Install and launch this packaged app.
4. Press the button to toggle the LED.

Future version: use the standard Firmata sketch and build a JS firmata driver
for Chrome packaged apps.
